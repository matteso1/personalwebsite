# Building a Smart Transit System: From Data Collection to Machine Learning

*How I created an intelligent bus tracking system for UW-Madison using real-time data collection, machine learning, and modern web technologies.*

## The Problem

As a computer science student at UW-Madison, I was constantly frustrated by the unreliability of the campus bus system. The official Madison Metro app would show a bus arriving "in 5 minutes" only to have it show up 15 minutes late, causing me to miss classes or stand in the cold Wisconsin weather. I realized this was a perfect opportunity to apply data science and machine learning to solve a real-world problem that affects thousands of students daily.

## The Vision

I wanted to build something that went beyond just showing bus locations - I envisioned a smart transit companion that could:
- Predict actual arrival times using historical patterns
- Provide real-time delay notifications  
- Visualize transit patterns across the city
- Learn from user behavior to improve accuracy over time

## Technical Architecture

### Data Collection Pipeline
The foundation of any good ML system is quality data. I built a sophisticated data collection system that runs 24/7:

**Backend Data Collector** (`optimal_collector.py`)
- Continuously polls the Madison Metro API every 30 seconds
- Smart scheduling that adapts to bus frequency patterns
- Collects vehicle positions, passenger loads, delays, and predictions
- Has gathered over **129,000 records** across multiple data types

**Data Quality**: 89.19% - ensuring reliable training data for ML models

### Real-Time API Layer
I created a Flask-based API system that serves as the bridge between raw transit data and the user interface:

**Main API** (`app.py`) - Proxies Madison Metro API calls with CORS handling
**Analytics API** (`data_analysis_api.py`) - Processes collected data for visualizations
- Route analysis and performance metrics
- Temporal patterns (rush hour, weekend variations)  
- Geospatial clustering of transit hubs
- Real-time statistics for the dashboard

### Machine Learning Pipeline
The ML system is designed for production scalability with multiple model types:

**Model Architecture**:
- **XGBoost & LightGBM**: For fast, accurate delay predictions
- **Neural Networks**: For complex pattern recognition in temporal data
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models for better accuracy

**Features Engineered**:
- Time-based features (hour, day of week, semester patterns)
- Route-specific patterns and historical performance
- Weather correlations and special events
- Passenger load impact on delays

**Current Performance**: 87.5% prediction accuracy on delay forecasting

### Frontend Experience
Built with React and modern web technologies for a responsive, intuitive experience:

**Live Map View**:
- Real-time bus positions with route overlays
- Interactive heatmap showing transit density hotspots  
- Dynamic route selection and live tracking

**Data Visualizations**:
- Route performance analytics with interactive charts
- Temporal pattern analysis (rush hour trends, seasonal variations)
- Geospatial analysis showing major transit hubs
- Real-time statistics dashboard

**Smart Features**:
- Personalized route suggestions
- Delay predictions with confidence intervals
- Historical accuracy tracking

## Key Technical Achievements

- Weekend patterns show 40% lower usage
- Finals week shows increased late-night usage

**Delay Patterns**:
- Weather correlates with 23% increase in delays
- Rush hour delays average 8.3 minutes above schedule
- Route efficiency varies significantly by time of day
